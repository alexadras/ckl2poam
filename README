Converts DISA's stig_viewer checklist file (ckl) to a POA&M Excel spreadsheet (xlsx). When using the DISA stig_viewer you can save your checklist where the output is a CKL file (really just an XML file). ckl2poam takes the XML output (the CKL file) and puts it into POA&M format, preserving the status and comments fields. The Excel spreadsheet (xlsx) features two tabs: POA&M and Remediation. This allows mitigators to use DISA's stig_viewer as their checklist tool as they manually walk a STIG and then put the output into something that both management (POA&M tab) and sysadmin's (Remediation tab) will be able to use. Please note that the comments field from the checklist file is only dropped into the Remediation tab and not the POA&M tab (it is left blank).

A CLI and a GUI version of this tool are available. I have also used pyinstaller to create win32 binaries so that systems without Python can still use the tool.
