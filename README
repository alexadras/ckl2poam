Converts DISA's stig_viewer checklist file (ckl) to a POA&M Excel spreadsheet (xlsx). When using the DISA stig_viewer you can save your checklist where the output is a CKL file (really just an XML file). ckl2poam takes the XML output (the CKL file) and puts it into POA&M format, preserving the status and comments fields. The Excel spreadsheet (xlsx) features two tabs: POA&M and Remediation. This allows mitigators to use DISA's stig_viewer as their checklist tool as they manually walk a STIG and then put the output into something that both management (POA&M tab) and sysadmin's (Remediation tab) will be able to use. Both the "Finding Details" and "Comments" text fields are preserved in both tabs. 

To run the python tools, you will need to install openpyxl (pip install openpyxl).

A CLI and a GUI version of this tool is available. 

I have also used pyinstaller to create win32 binaries so that Microsoft Windows systems without Python can still use the tool.
